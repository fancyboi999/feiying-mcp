FastMCP 2.9

\\
**FastMCP 2.9: MCP-Native Middleware** \\
\\
FastMCP 2.9 is a major release that, among other things, introduces two important features that push beyond the basic MCP protocol.\\
\\
ü§ù _MCP Middleware_ brings a flexible middleware system for intercepting and controlling server operations - think authentication, logging, rate limiting, and custom business logic without touching core protocol code.\\
\\
‚ú® _Server-side type conversion_ for prompts solves a major developer pain point: while MCP requires string arguments, your functions can now work with native Python types like lists and dictionaries, with automatic conversion handling the complexity.\\
\\
These features transform FastMCP from a simple protocol implementation into a powerful framework for building sophisticated MCP applications. Combined with the new `File` utility for binary data and improvements to authentication and serialization, this release makes FastMCP significantly more flexible and developer-friendly while maintaining full protocol compliance.\\

[**FastMCP 2.8: Transform and Roll Out**](https://www.jlowin.dev/blog/fastmcp-2-8-tool-transformation)

[FastMCP 2.8 is here, and it‚Äôs all about taking control of your tools.\\
\\
This release is packed with new features for curating the perfect LLM experience:\\
\\
üõ†Ô∏è Tool Transformation\\
\\
The headline feature lets you wrap any tool‚Äîfrom your own code, a third-party library, or an OpenAPI spec‚Äîto create an enhanced, LLM-friendly version. You can rename arguments, rewrite descriptions, and hide parameters without touching the original code.](https://www.jlowin.dev/blog/fastmcp-2-8-tool-transformation)

[This feature was developed in close partnership with Bill Easton. As Bill brilliantly](https://www.jlowin.dev/blog/fastmcp-2-8-tool-transformation) [put it](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/williamseaston_huge-thanks-to-william-easton-for-providing-activity-7338011349525983232-Mw6T?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAAd6d0B3uL9zpCsq9eYWKi3HIvb8eN_r_Q), ‚ÄúTool transformation flips Prompt Engineering on its head: stop writing tool-friendly LLM prompts and start providing LLM-friendly tools.‚Äù

üè∑Ô∏è Component Control

Now that you‚Äôre transforming tools, you need a way to hide the old ones! In FastMCP 2.8 you can programmatically enable/disable any component, and for everyone who‚Äôs been asking what FastMCP‚Äôs tags are for‚Äîthey finally have a purpose! You can now use tags to declaratively filter which components are exposed to your clients.

üöÄ Pragmatic by Default

Lastly, to ensure maximum compatibility with the ecosystem, we‚Äôve made the pragmatic decision to default all OpenAPI routes to Tools, making your entire API immediately accessible to any tool-using agent. When the industry catches up and supports resources, we‚Äôll restore the old default ‚Äî but no reason you should do extra work before OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google!

FastMCP 2.7

Releases

June 6, 2025

[![release-2-7](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/fastmcp/assets/updates/release-2-7.png)\\
\\
**FastMCP 2.7: Pare Programming** \\
\\
FastMCP 2.7 has been released!\\
\\
Most notably, it introduces the highly requested (and Pythonic) ‚Äúnaked‚Äù decorator usage:\\
\\
Copy\\
\\
Ask AI\\
\\
```\\
mcp = FastMCP()\\
\\
@mcp.tool\\
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:\\
    return a + b\\
\\
```\\
\\
In addition, decorators now return the objects they create, instead of the decorated function. This is an important usability enhancement.\\
\\
The bulk of the update is focused on improving the FastMCP internals, including a few breaking internal changes to private APIs. A number of functions that have clung on since 1.0 are now deprecated.\\

**Reflecting on FastMCP at 10k stars üåü** \\
\\
In just six weeks since its relaunch, FastMCP has surpassed 10,000 GitHub stars‚Äîbecoming the fastest-growing OSS project in our orbit. What started as a personal itch has become the backbone of Python-based MCP servers, powering a rapidly expanding ecosystem. While the protocol itself evolves, FastMCP continues to lead with clarity, developer experience, and opinionated tooling. Here‚Äôs to what‚Äôs next.\\

**Now Streaming: FastMCP 2.3** \\
\\
FastMCP 2.3 introduces full support for Streamable HTTP, a modern alternative to SSE that simplifies MCP deployments over the web. It‚Äôs efficient, reliable, and now the default HTTP transport. Just run your server with transport=‚Äúhttp‚Äù and connect clients via a standard URL‚ÄîFastMCP handles the rest. No special setup required. This release makes deploying MCP servers easier and more portable than ever.\\

\\
**MCP Proxy Servers with FastMCP 2.0** \\
\\
Even AI needs a good travel adapter üîå\\
\\
FastMCP now supports proxying arbitrary MCP servers, letting you run a local FastMCP instance that transparently forwards requests to any remote or third-party server‚Äîregardless of transport. This enables transport bridging (e.g., stdio ‚áÑ SSE), simplified client configuration, and powerful gateway patterns. Proxies are fully composable with other FastMCP servers, letting you mount or import them just like local servers. Use `FastMCP.from_client()` to wrap any backend in a clean, Pythonic proxy.\\
